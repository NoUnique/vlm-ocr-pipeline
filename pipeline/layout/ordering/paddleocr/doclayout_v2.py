"""PP-DocLayoutV2 sorter.

PP-DocLayoutV2 detector uses a lightweight pointer network (6 Transformer layers)
to restore reading order during detection. This sorter preserves that ordering
instead of re-sorting with a different algorithm.

This sorter also includes overlap filtering to remove redundant duplicate detections,
matching the behavior of PaddleOCR-VL's original implementation.

    PP-DocLayoutV2 detector sorts blocks by Y-coordinate (top-to-bottom) during detection.

    Note on Pointer Network:
    While the PP-DocLayoutV2 model includes a pointer network for reading order,
    PaddleOCR/PaddleX Python API does NOT expose this information.
    The detector falls back to Y-coordinate sorting, which this sorter preserves.

    Coupling:
        This sorter is tightly coupled with the paddleocr-doclayout-v2 detector.
