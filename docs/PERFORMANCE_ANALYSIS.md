# Performance Analysis and Optimization

This document describes the performance analysis of the VLM OCR Pipeline and identifies optimization opportunities.

## Performance Profiling Tools

The project includes two profiling tools:

1. **scripts/benchmark.py**: Simple timing benchmark for overall pipeline performance
2. **scripts/profile_pipeline.py**: Detailed cProfile-based profiling for function-level analysis
3. **pipeline/profiling.py**: Performance metrics collection utilities with decorators

### Usage

```bash
# Simple benchmark (overall timing)
python scripts/benchmark.py --input document.pdf --max-pages 1 --detector doclayout-yolo

# Detailed profiling
python scripts/profile_pipeline.py --input document.pdf --max-pages 1 --detailed

# Save results to JSON
python scripts/benchmark.py --input doc.pdf --max-pages 5 --output results.json
```

## Identified Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. PDF Rendering (High Impact)

**Issue**: `pdf2image.convert_from_path()` renders PDF pages to images, which is CPU and memory intensive.

**Location**: `pipeline/conversion/input/pdf.py:render_pdf_page()`

**Current Behavior**:
```python
images = convert_from_path(pdf_path, first_page=page_num, last_page=page_num, dpi=200)
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Use PyMuPDF's `get_pixmap()` for faster rendering (2-3x speedup)
- Reduce DPI for non-critical pages (trade quality for speed)
- Implement parallel rendering for multi-page PDFs
- Cache rendered images when processing the same PDF multiple times

**Estimated Impact**: 30-50% reduction in Stage 1 (Input) time

---

### 2. PyMuPDF Document Reopening (Medium Impact)

**Issue**: PDF files may be opened multiple times during processing:
- Once for page rendering
- Again for text span extraction (if using font-based headers)
- Potentially again for PyMuPDF sorter

**Location**: `pipeline/conversion/input/pdf.py:extract_text_spans_from_pdf()`

**Current Behavior**:
```python
with open_pdf_document(pdf_path) as doc:
    # Extract text spans for a single page
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Open PDF once and pass the document object to all functions
- Cache document handle at Pipeline level
- Batch extract text spans for all pages at once

**Estimated Impact**: 10-20% reduction in Stage 1 time for multi-page PDFs

---

### 3. List Operations and Block Processing (Low-Medium Impact)

**Issue**: Multiple passes over block lists for different operations:
- Detection
- Sorting
- Column layout extraction
- Text extraction
- Correction

**Location**: Multiple locations in `pipeline/__init__.py`

**Current Behavior**:
```python
# Multiple separate iterations
sorted_blocks = self.ordering_stage.sort(blocks, ...)
column_layout = self.detection_stage.extract_column_layout(sorted_blocks)
processed_blocks = self.recognition_stage.recognize_blocks(sorted_blocks, ...)
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Combine operations where possible
- Use generator expressions for lazy evaluation
- Pre-allocate result lists with known sizes
- Use numpy arrays for block coordinates (vectorized operations)

**Estimated Impact**: 5-10% reduction in overall processing time

---

### 4. Image Memory Management (Medium Impact)

**Issue**: Large numpy arrays (images) are passed between functions, potentially causing unnecessary copies.

**Location**: Throughout recognition and detection stages

**Current Behavior**:
```python
block_image = block.bbox.crop(image, padding=5)
# block_image passed to multiple functions
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Context managers for automatic cleanup (pipeline/resources.py)
- Use array views instead of copies where possible
- Implement image pyramid for multi-scale processing
- Compress images before API calls (if backend supports)

**Estimated Impact**: 10-15% reduction in memory usage, 5-10% speed improvement

**Status**: Context managers implemented in commit bd0167c

---

### 5. VLM API Calls (High Impact, Limited Optimization)

**Issue**: Network latency and API processing time dominate Stage 4 (Recognition).

**Location**: `pipeline/recognition/api/` modules

**Current Behavior**:
- Sequential API calls for each block
- Rate limiting may add delays

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Caching system to avoid redundant API calls
- Batch processing where API supports it (Gemini batch API)
- Parallel processing with async/await (within rate limits)
- Request compression for faster uploads
- Use lower-tier models for simple text blocks

**Estimated Impact**: 20-40% reduction in Stage 4 time (with caching and batching)

**Status**: Caching implemented, batching opportunity remains

---

### 6. Unnecessary gc.collect() Calls (Low Impact)

**Issue**: Manual `gc.collect()` calls may slow down execution unnecessarily.

**Location**: Various locations (now centralized in context managers)

**Current Behavior**:
```python
del large_object
gc.collect()  # May pause execution
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Remove manual gc.collect(), rely on automatic GC
- Only force GC after processing each page (not each block)

**Estimated Impact**: 2-5% speed improvement

**Status**: Improved with context managers in commit bd0167c

## Monitoring Performance

### Enable Profiling in Code

```python
from pipeline.profiling import get_metrics, measure_time

# Enable metrics collection
metrics = get_metrics()
metrics.enable()

# Use context manager for timing
with measure_time("my_operation"):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Print report
metrics.print_report()
```

### Decorator-Based Profiling

```python
from pipeline.profiling import timed

@timed("expensive_function")
def process_blocks(blocks):
    # Function implementation
    pass
```
